LapTime
=======
LapTime is an AppleScript library to measure execution time of a script of AppleScript.
It is useful to evaluate performance of a script and to tune up the script.

You can measure execution time by using current date command which is AppleScript's built-in command.
But time resolution of AppleScript's date class is 1 sec, which is too rough for performance measurements.
By using NSDate of Cocoa, the time resolution of LapTime is below a few msec.
